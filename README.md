This is meant to be a lightweight, as simple as possible, static website.  The idea is to establish an online presence, untied to any platform, for which I control all of the data.

This is likely to be a good place for:
* "about me"
* links to profiles on third-party platforms
* a resume
* a blog

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) offers source and website hosting, no-thinking-necessary source-to-website translation (via server-side [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)), and a push-to-publish process, for free.  So, we'll use this infrastructural stack while minimizing our dependency on the underlying tools, with the mindset that while this substrate may change over time, the content must remain first-class.
